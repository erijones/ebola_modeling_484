Hey guys,
So yesterday I was working on implementing the Jacobian and then ended up making a lot of edits to the code (with the help of Ben Sattleberg...he was great)

The biggest improvement was removing the plotting from the seir_parameter_fit.m file
It seems that it was generating a plot for every iteration of fminsearch and thus made our code quite a bit slower than it needed to be.

Thus, I made a new function called GraphIt which is basically our old seir_parameter_fit file, but since we only call it after we have minimized our parameter fits, it runs much faster. 

After this I did a bunch of cleaning....I made a uniform manner in which to order our variables which is as follows: alpha, beta1, beta2, beta3, delta, gamma1, psi, gamma, rho1, rho2, omega


Everything should appear much neater now...I have also moved our system to a seperate file called SEIHRRR just to make everything cleaner. 

With all these edits, the program can now run in 7 seconds (before it was about 2-3 minutes).
However, we are still getting negative parameter values even when calling the jacobian.
Furthermore, the program actually runs slower (38 s) when we use the jacobian....I'm not sure why this is....however, when using the jacobian we do get a better looking fit....

I can explain anything else later!
