Meeting with Professor Pankavich

-Our matlab code makes some sense
	
-Is our initial guess for k valid? Our original guess might effect 
	
our fit
	
-We should probably NOT treat beta as 0 as we have been doing
	
-We are not quite using the 'log-fit' correctly
		
-We should take the log of all populations
			
-i.e. s~=log(s)...etc
			
-compute differential equations your ~ functions satisfy
- Our modified model should probably be made simpler
- Still only have one removed population, and create an interaction term between the 
  removed population and the susceptible population with a coefficient that takes into 
  account the amount that are not buried as well as the infection rate
-Plan to have a phone conference with Sarah (I think that is her name) in the 
upcoming week
	
-We should be devising some questions to ask her regarding the project
	
-Professor Pankavich is setting up a date and time
