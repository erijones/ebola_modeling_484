Understanding the Dynamics of Ebola Epidemics
-average Incubation period 1-2 weeks
-death after an average of 10 days in 50-90% of infections
-transmitabillity increases with duration of disease
-Lots of statistical analysis (Maximum Likelihood estimators, CI's]
-Stoichastic compartmental model
-Weekly Incidences Poission distributed 

Dynamics and Control of Ebol virus transmission in Montserrado, Liberia
-Epidemic is increasing most rapidly in Liberia who are at a socioeconomic disadvantage to the other two countries
-overcrowded Urban areas can present an exceptionally high risk for disease transmission
-model assumes individuals who die recieve sanitary burials which prevent transmission after death
-"The assumption that daily reported cases accurately represens  the number of individuals entering the 
infectious class, without taking into acocunt under-reporting or delays in reporting" lead to underestimation

Early Epidemic Dynamics
-Incidence decay with exponential adjustment model to evaluate epidemic dynamics
-Agreement between IDEA model and SIR when R0 is low or moderate 
-given functional form
